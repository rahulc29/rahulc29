## About me âœ¨
I'm Rahul Chhabra (he/they), a student of Information Technology at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad, batch of 2025.

## Currently Working On ðŸ”­

### Scheme to JavaScript Compiler

Brendan Eich, the inventor of Javascript once commented how Scheme was the original source of inspiration and how if it weren't for management pressure and lack of time - Javascript would be extremely similar to Scheme. So I thought, why not just cut to the chase and use Scheme directly? This project aims to achieve just that. Javascript was not meant to be written by humans, as I have come to discover, it was barely meant to be written by compilers either. 

### Formalisation in Cubical Type Theory

Currently only [the formalisation of regular languages' trie representation](https://github.com/rahulc29/regular-languages). The trie representation comes from the coalgebraic interpretation of automata. I hope to extend Traytel's original representation to probabilistic and weighted automata. Of course, I'm not yet sure how I will possibly encode probability theory in cubical type theory since currently no real library for it exists. It would be a massive pain to have to write one myself.

## Currently Learning ðŸŒ±

### Cubical Type Theory

Arguably the most beautiful thing I have ever studied, cubical type theory is the constructive model of homotopy type theory (Martin-Lof's type theory extended with univalence axiom and higher inductive types). Higher inductive types are so unimaginably powerful - I intend to create a project where I use a quotient type (a kind of higher inductive type) to have semantic equivalences quotiented from the abstract syntax trees. It's unlikely I will be able to find the time anytime soon.

### Coalgebra Theory

Coalgebras are a beautiful dual to algebras. They capture the essence of dynamical systems so beautifully well it is insane. Besides, I also plan to study related stuff like process theory and non-well-founded set theory.

### Database Theory

This is a bit of a todo. There are many cool connections between category theory and databases (of the relational kind). Besides I do not yet understand how practical databases minimise disc IO calls and how would one go about formally proving the strategies as optimal? I wish to explore all these questions.

## Suggestions âš¡

Once upon a time I was introduced to the world of functional programming by the wonderful [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf) and I've not gotten out of the rabbit hole since. That book changed my brain forever and I don't think there's any way I will ever be able to thank the authors enough.

Another book that was life changing in a very similar way is [Category Theory for Programmers](https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf). This book taught me about the mathematical aspects of programming for the first time. I cannot recommend this book enough. If you've ever written a single line of code, this knowledge deserves to possess you.

Wadler's [Programming Language Foundations in Agda](https://plfa.github.io/) taught me Agda and programming language semantics and it is extremely accessible to anybody with no formal training in any related field.

Robert Sedgewick's "Algorithms" is another classic. For one thing, the proofs are very well presented. Secondly, it is, in my opinion, a lot more rigourous with the mathematics.

[Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) is another classic and was so helpful when I was studying operating systems. It is an absolutely beautiful text.

I generally prefer open source and free texts - knowledge is not be imprisoned.
