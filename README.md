I'm Rahul Chhabra (he/they), a student of Information Technology at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad, graduating in 2025.

 My primary interests are best described by ["computational trinitarianism"](https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/27/the-holy-trinity/) - logic, category theory, dependent type theory (especially cubical ones), and the development and engineering of proof assistants.

Much of my work right now is on my [realizability project](https://github.com/rahulc29/realizability) - a formalisation of categorical realizability from the ground up in Cubical Agda.
