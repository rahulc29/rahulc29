## About me âœ¨
I'm Rahul Chhabra (he/they), a student of Information Technology at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad, batch of 2025.

## Currently Working On ðŸ”­

### Scheme to JavaScript Compiler

Brendan Eich, the inventor of Javascript once commented how Scheme was the original source of inspiration and how if it weren't for management pressure and lack of time - Javascript would be extremely similar to Scheme. So I thought, why not just cut to the chase and use Scheme directly? This project aims to achieve just that. Javascript was not meant to be written by humans, as I have come to discover, it was barely meant to be written by compilers either. 

### Formalisation in Type Theory

My formalisation interests include : 

1. Modal and temporal logics - In particular, the relationship between temporal logics and functional reactive programs.
2. General recursion in type theory - This includes the free monad and giving general recursive programs (written in, say, Agda) semantics using monad homomorphisms. Cool stuff.
3. Automata and Coalgebra.

## Currently Learning ðŸŒ±

### Cubical Type Theory

Arguably the most beautiful thing I have ever studied, cubical type theory is the constructive model of homotopy type theory (Martin-Lof's type theory extended with univalence axiom and higher inductive types). Higher inductive types are so unimaginably powerful - I absolutely love them. Their recursion and induction principles can be goofy if one is not careful. 

### Coalgebra Theory

Coalgebras are a beautiful dual to algebras. They capture the essence of dynamical systems so beautifully well it is insane. Besides, I also plan to study related stuff like process theory and non-well-founded set theory.

### Formal Topology

Formal topology develops topology within a constructive setting. As such, it can be implemented in a language like Agda. 

### Non-Interference 

Non-interference involves having a `high` and `low` security levels and it is possible to write compilers that ensure that security constraints are respected. One can even go ahead and prove the correctness of such a compiler. See [ayberkt/simplc](https://github.com/ayberkt/simplc).

## Suggestions âš¡

Once upon a time I was introduced to the world of functional programming by the wonderful [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf) and I've not gotten out of the rabbit hole since. That book changed my brain forever and I don't think there's any way I will ever be able to thank the authors enough.

Another book that was life changing in a very similar way is [Category Theory for Programmers](https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf). This book taught me about the mathematical aspects of programming for the first time. I cannot recommend this book enough. If you've ever written a single line of code, this knowledge deserves to possess you.

Wadler's [Programming Language Foundations in Agda](https://plfa.github.io/) taught me Agda and programming language semantics and it is extremely accessible to anybody with no formal training in any related field.

Robert Sedgewick's "Algorithms" is another classic. For one thing, the proofs are very well presented. Secondly, it is, in my opinion, a lot more rigourous with the mathematics.

[Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) is another classic and was so helpful when I was studying operating systems. It is an absolutely beautiful text.

I generally prefer open source and free texts - knowledge is not be imprisoned.
