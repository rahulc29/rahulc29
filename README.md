## About me âœ¨
I'm Rahul Chhabra, a citizen of Geekland and a student of Information Technology at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad, batch of 2025.

I'm most comfortable in C++ and Kotlin, followed by Java. 

## Currently Interested In âš¡
My interests are varied and consist of low-level systems (such as old 8-bit systems, e.g. the NES and CHIP-8) and their emulation, the internal workings of operating systems, cryptography and network security, and given anything sufficiently complex and mathematical, there exists a time at which I'll develop an interest in it.

Another interest I've recently developed is automata theory and compiler design. Compilers are _ridiculously_ complicated and difficult and that makes them a lot of fun. I'm currently studying a lot about compilation algorithms and it's honestly amazing.

## Currently Working On ðŸ”­

### k8
k8 is a CHIP-8 emulator written in Kotlin/JVM. The emulator doesn't shy away from using Kotlin idiomatics and is imagined and constructed in Kotlin entirely. The entire emulator is written to be extensible and allow for at least two frontends - an android one and a JavaFX one for desktop environments. 

### kaleido
Kaleido is a toy programming language compiler written in C++ to better understand compiler design in general and the LLVM infrastructure in particular. I aim to survive the entirety of the LLVM tutorials and if I do, I'll have a Turing complete programming language with `if-else`, `for`, `while`, functions, variable assignments and (hopefully) some sense of satisfaction.

## Currently Learning ðŸŒ±

### Rust
I'm learning and oh my god it is so damn good. Imagine everything wrong with C++ (null unsafe, optional ownership, access to raw pointers) and now imagine it fixed. Ownership can be tricky if you don't use move semantics in C++ but is not all that bad. The Rust compiler is a pain to deal with sometimes but the error messages are helpful enough.

### DSA and Competitive Programming
I'm currently working very hard to get better at DSA-based problems. I'm currently super into trees and graphs and have been solving a lot of problems related to them. To follow my CP progress, do checkout my [CP Repository](https://github.com/rahulc29/cp)
