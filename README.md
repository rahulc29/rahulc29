## About me âœ¨
I'm Rahul Chhabra, a citizen of Geekland and a student of Information Technology at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad.
My primary linguistic proficiency is in Kotlin, followed by Java, that is to say, I try to Kotlin-idiomatic code and refrain from "translating Java to Kotlin" in favour of "thinking in Kotlin". Besides, I use C++ for competitive programming.

## Currently Interested In âš¡
My interests are varied and consist of low-level systems (such as old 8-bit systems, e.g. the NES and CHIP-8) and their emulation, the internal workings of operating systems, cryptography and network security, and given anything sufficiently complex and mathematical, there exists a time at which I'll develop an interest in it.

Another interest I've recently developed is automata theory and compiler design. Compilers are _ridiculously_ complicated and difficult and that makes them a lot of fun. I'm currently studying a lot about compilation algorithms and it's honestly amazing.

## Currently Working On ðŸ”­

### k8
k8 is a CHIP-8 emulator written in Kotlin/JVM. The emulator doesn't shy away from using Kotlin idiomatics and is imagined and constructed in Kotlin entirely. The entire emulator is written to be extensible and allow for at least two frontends - an android one and a JavaFX one for desktop environments. 

### kaleido
Kaleido is a toy programming language compiler written in C++ to better understand compiler design in general and the LLVM infrastructure in particular. I aim to survive the entirety of the LLVM tutorials and if I do, I'll have a Turing complete programming language with `if-else`, `for`, `while`, functions, variable assignments and some sense of satisfaction.

## Currently Learning ðŸŒ±

### Golang
I'm currently learning the Golang programming language and trying to internalise the philosophy and the paradigm that exists within the language. Golang is nothing like anything I've ever worked with, and therefore is making for a great challenge on an intellectual level.

### DSA and Competitive Programming
I'm currently working very hard to get better at DSA-based problems and trying to learn more about the mathematical details of problem-solving everyday.
