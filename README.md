Hi!

I'm Rahul Chhabra (he/they), undergrad at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad.

My primary interests are homotopy type theory, categorical realizability and higher category theory.

I have formalised in Cubical Agda a significant part of categorical realizability in my [realizability project](https://github.com/rahulc29/realizability).
